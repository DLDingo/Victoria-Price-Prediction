# **Property Prediction**

This is my capstone project for my studies in Data Science with the Digital Futures Academy.

# **Project Aims**

This is an exploratory data science prject which aims to find a way to predict the price of property by using linear regression. Whilst it is well known that certain things affect the price, (number of bedrooms, style of property, etc). My project aims to see which metrics are most important and then utilise them to predict the price of properties sold at auction.

# **Methods**

The property details and price were taken from a dataset provided on kaggle. They were then cleaned and processed in order to determine usefullness of columns. Following this, Predictions made using linear regression, and elastic net regression.

# **Conclusion**

Whilst the predictions provide a ballpark figure, there is much more data required for the predictions to be more useful. The problem here is that there are so many factors involved with house pricing, that can not be meaningfully incorporated into this, such as state of the property.

# **Further Plans**

A different dataset which includes room sizes, where possible, would be much more beneficial. This is because it would allow for a deeper understanding for how room size affects the price.
